* Unit test :
  ------
   unit - {function, Class, Object, Feature, shared-Feature, Lines Of Codes, ViewModels}

   ViewModels must be always testable
     \
      - No UI Code 
      - No BuildContext must present in it. (otherwise need to start up flutter i.e emulator)

* Mocks
  -----
   -> Mockito 
       - ensures us to verify some function is called ot not

    Third party libraries are often going to be mocked. (without being aware about Low-Level Code)

Basic Steps : 

  1) Interaction & Setup 
  2) Execute/Run 
  3) Verification & Error Handling
  4) TearDown  (release Unneeded resources)


* Configurations for tests :
  --------------
   -> configurations:{
       ....
       ....
       "program": "./tests/"
   }

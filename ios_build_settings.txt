Usually this is how I do it.
flutter clean
flutter pub get
cd ios
pod install
open ios in xcode
create archive


To see logs in release mode : 

   adb logcat --pid=`adb shell pidof -s com.hashtag.poker.app.dev`


Pod issues (for m1 ) to update pod repo :
  
  command :- `arch -x86_64 pod repo update`

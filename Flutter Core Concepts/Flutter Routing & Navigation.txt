* ModalRoute
  ---
  -> You can implement your custom popup by extending the ModalRoute class

* MaterialApp | Navigator | WidgetsApp
  -----
  Inside MaterialApp you have a param :- builder

  MaterialApp provides you the Navigator &
   |
   MaterialApp > WidgetsApp > Navigator > HomePage
                               |
                               This Navigator is implicit or generate by the `builder` param of MaterialApp

  NOTE: WidgetsApp holds many useful utilities such as Theme, Localization, MediaQuery, etc...
        but
        Navigator is available after that hence Navigator also can utilize the WidgetsApp provided things

* Custom Navigator :
  -----
  To have your custom Navigator (for nested navigation)
  i.e Navigator apart from provided by MaterialApp
  |
  You can use Navigator() :- that primarily takes 3 args (onGenerateRoute, home, key)

  NOTE: key is a global key that helps to manage the navigator api's


* key & Navigator & MaterialApp :
  ------
  You can assign the key to your material app widget that can refere NavigatorState as GlobalKey
  &
  then you can utilize this globally in your app to perform behaviors exposed by Navigator.of(context)
  without use of context but just with this key (ie global key associated with MaterialApp's Navigator State)
  |
  You can perform task such as pop(), push(), etc... with the help of this global navigator key

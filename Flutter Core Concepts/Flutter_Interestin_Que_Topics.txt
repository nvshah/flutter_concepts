1) How Widgets Render Itself ? 
   i.e Widget Tree, Element Tree, Render Object tree  (Foundation)

   What is the Layer Tree ?
    -> All the paint operations for each layer

1.1) How you can avoid extra Repainting of your Flutter Widget/RenderObject ??

    -> You can wrap your content with RepaintBoundary(),
       this will provide the corresp RenderObject its own Layer
       &
       thus these can lead to Rasterization if things (pixels) remains same ahead in time

1.2) What is Rasterization ?
     -> If a part of Layer Tree remains unchanged, then Flutter engine can reuse this pixels
      this is called Rasterization

     What can help to achieve the Rasterization ?
     -> RepaintBoundary() Widget

1.3) What does build phase does (ie build())
   -> It updates the element tree

1.4) What is significance of RenderObject ??

    -> State Restoration keyStore provided by flutter
    -> Hydrated BLOC

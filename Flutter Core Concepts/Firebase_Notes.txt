* Logged In or Logged Out :
  ---------------
   -> When you are logged out then currentUser() on firebaseAuth always returns null


* Whenever user Logged In or Update some info :
  -----------
    Just Populate latest user info from firestore & store it in local variable

    (ASA You signup, login ,update...) User info is ready ot be used inside application

    Make this thing atomic


* Firestore Transactions :
  ----------
  - Firebase Firestore offers a mechanism for committing transactions, where you can run multiple queries
    all at once within the same transaction similar to how transaction works in SQL.
    Either whole operation succeeds or the whole thin fails & rolls back!

  - Within the Transactions you can perform get(), update(), delete(), set() operations on document reference.

  - The runTransaction() is a generic func i.e that the val which you return from this func will then
    be returned at the end to the call-site
    (At the end means when transaction completes)

* Side Effects :
  ------
   -> when a class or method do something else than what it intended to do so then it is known as Side Effect 
    

* Packages vs Pluginns :
  ------
   Plugins are special type of packages   

   Flutter -> Dart Files ;- needs packages 
      \
       -> Now if those packages rely on Native/Platform Specific code then it is known as Plugin Packages 
          otherwise
          It is called as Package (that contains only dart codes)

* What if we have 2 runApp() inside flutter project ?

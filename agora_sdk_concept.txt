   Single Engine - for AppId


* RtcEngine :- 
  RtcChannel :-

* Multi Channel 
  _____________

  Tip : Agora recommends joining a channel as a host when the user needs to publish local streams 
        or as an audience member when the user does not need to publish local streams.

  The SDK supports publishing one stream to only one channel at a time

  Join: Join the channel and see other people who are publishing their stream.  (ENTER)
  Leave: Disconnect from the channel stream.                                    (EXIT)
  Publish: Publish your video stream into the channel for others to see.        (PUBLISH)
  Unpublish: Remove your stream from the channel while remaining in the channel to see others. (WATCH ONLY)

  Callbacks :
  --------
   fired while hearing event handlers

   NOTE : When using the AgoraChannel object, the users behave like a Broadcasting channel profile
          Joining a channel doesn’t mean you automatically publish your video feed, too, as in Communication mode

          we have to join a channel and publish our stream in order for others in the channel to see and hear us.


          RemoteVideoStats : The remote video stats determine if the video surface should be added or removed based on the data they are sending across the network
                            If their data bitrate is zero, they aren’t publishing and their video surface should be removed. If their bitrate is greater than zero, 
                            they are publishing and their video should be displayed.

In the RtcEngine class, the SDK publishes the local stream by default.
In the RtcChannel class, the SDK does not publish the local stream.

* Connection :
  ---------
  Agora SDK tries to rejoin channel for 20 mins


* Publish & Subscribe :
  ---------------
  After creating the local tracks and successfully joining a channel, 
  you can call AgoraRTCClient.publish to publish the local audio and video data to the channel for other users to subscribe to it.


* Resolution, frame rate and bitrate (https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/video_profile_android#resolution-frame-rate-and-bitrate)

  setVideoEncoderConfiguration()

   Agora recommends calling `setVideoEncoderConfiguration` before enableVideo

````
engine.adjustAudioMixingPublishVolume()    //audio volume to be send to users
       adjustAudioMixingPlayoutVolume()    //audio volume to be played for me
       adjustAudioMixingVolume()           //for both


# Default Audio Route - Speaker or EarPiece

-> https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/API Reference/flutter/rtc_engine/RtcEngine/setDefaultAudioRoutetoSpeakerphone.html


# Video Profile & Zomm Level



! Why Resetting Entire Channel here before introducing new channel with same engine ??
  -> As there is something issue with agora sdk for syncing the media pref with channel creation for second time with same engine

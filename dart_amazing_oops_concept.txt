* Interface vs Abstraction :  (Inheritance vs Implementation)
  -----------------------
   Interface is 100% Abstraction 


   Inheritance : 
   ---------
    -> When you inherit any class using `extends`, Constructor of parent is called compulsory
       i.e proxy object mechanism 

   Implementation :
   --------
    -> When you implement any class in dart i.e It will implement interface (implicit) of that class 
       i.e it will obey contract that is present in that class

       But here Parent class Constructor is not called & It is totally isolated from child class, when we talk
       about implementation.

   When you inherit any abstracted class then you do need to call construtor of that abstracted class.


   So in inheritance Constructor of abstracted class is called (internally)
   But When there comes implementation i.e interface then There is no concept of proxy object & super() call.

Images & Flutter

useful packages :
----
-> heic_to_jpg,
-> flutter_image_compress  // convert to jpg
-> mime        // infer file type from file data (ie bytes)
-> image

* Image & Flutter :
  ---------
  [Image Bytes -> Base64]
  https://www.fluttercampus.com/guide/224/convert-image-to-base64/

* Base64 vs Uint8List :
  -----------------
  Uint8List is bytes-array to represent the image
    |
    Base64 is used to encode such bytes-array into a text-repr so that it can be shared
    with others

    So when you decode Base64 encoded string often you expect it to be decoded into
    Bytes-Array

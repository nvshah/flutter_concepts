- Decoding Flutter

* PrimaryScrollController :
  ----
   - boolean parameter `primary` on

   -> Each Route Widget has a primaryScrollController wrapped around its SubTree !
      Which is an Inheroted Widget that allows
      Thus
      PrimaryScrollController.of(context)

   -> So Your ListView can subscribe to PrimaryScrollController of current Route
      Now
      Appbar of same Route can tell PrimaryScrollController about touch event
      & then ListView can listen this from controller present at top of route

   Error frol=m flutter ->
   `The ScrollController is attached to multiple ScrollView`
     \
      -> When more than 1 ScrollView are attached to same Inherited PrimaryScrollController

   -> This intersects with flutter focus system
       - Whatever Scrollable View get Focus, then regardless of primary=true or false
         Events like page+up & page+down will cause that Focussed widget to scroll

    Priority
    1. Focused Scrollable Widget (ie focused=true)
    2. Primary Scrollable Widget (ie primary=true)


* Focus
  ----
  -> Useful in the case considering Keyboard Shortcuts
  -> It contains FocusNodes
      \
       -> Tree of FocusNodes asides

  -> The purpose of focus Tree is that 1 node will always remains active

  => Keypress events bubbles up from active FocusNode
      \
       & whilst they bubble up they look for matching `Shortcut` widget
         So that they can turn into an intent object
         |
         then this intent obj is floated back to active focus widget (down the tree)

  - Button & TextField already contains the Focus Widget


* Shortcuts :
  ----
  -> Map Intent for each combintation of Keyboard Shortcuts
     \
      pass this intent info to Active Focus Node


* Actions :
  ----
  -> Actions widget will conclude the Intent generated by the Shortcut
     &
     Action Finishes it.

  -> Map intent -> action

* Entire Flow :
  ---
  When any keyboard activity is done then It will lifted up from Active Focus node till Shortcut found
  then
  Shortcut will identify the Intent for the activity (ie Shortcut arrived)
  then
  this intent will be given back to Active Focus Node to perform Some action correspondingly


* Gesture Arena
  --------------
  Eg GestureDetector()

  - Gesture Recognizer, Listener Callback

  Raw Interaction Data :
  ---
  Listener() widget   // Vaguely similar to GestureDetector
    \
     For recieving completely unprocessed interaction data from the Processor

  Gesture Disambiguation : How to identify multiple events happening at same time (eventually)
  |
  To deal with this there is concept of `Gesture Arena`

  REMEMBER :

  -> User interaction bubbles up the Widget tree with Descendents GestureDetector taking an edge/priority

  So if your widget's parent has GestureDetector with same listener the child will be considered

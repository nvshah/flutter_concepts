    You cann use param of GestureDetector :- `onTapDown`

* Dimensions & Constraints :
  ---
  (ref : Ui/Layout/Constraints)
  Child will not get always what dimension it defines. It depends on Parent
  & Under certain circumstance when child want more dimension & Parent doesnt allow
  Then Overflow will happen

  Otherwise Child will automatically tries to fit in the dimension provides by the Parent

  => SingleChildScrollView will try to do shrink Wrap by default

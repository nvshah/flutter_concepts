* Math Behind Animations :
  ----------
  
* Trigonometry :
  ------
   X Coordinate is Cosine 
   Y Coordinate is Sine 

   horizontal := X*Cos(theta)
   Vertical   := Y*Sin(theta)
   theta      := tan_inv(y/x)

* Coordinate System :
  -----
   1) Polar  
       -> (given radian & angle)
   2) Cartesian 
       -> (Origin at center of circle)
       -> Y axis go up from origin 

   3) Canva 
       -> (Origin at Top-Left Cornner)
       -> Y axis go down from origin

   radian :- 2*pi 
   angle  :- 360 degree

* Normalize Angle :
  ----------

  NOTE :- Computer do not return trigonometric value in 0 & 2*pi but 
                        it returns in range of -pi to pi
  
  So Normalzie value from (-Pi, Pi) -> (0, 2*Pi)
        \
         if theta < 0 :- 2*Pi + theta   mod 2*Pi 
         else         :- theta          mod 2*Pi
    
* Matrix  :
  ----
   Use to transform | rotate | Squeeze th vectors or Widgets inn Flutter 

* Animation Curve :
  ----- 
   - denotes the rate of change & function that needs to be followed whilst value change (animation)
   
   Egg Linear Function


-----------

* Animation Type :

  SizeTransition,    // Animate the widget based on size changes (in interval) based on animation spec
  SlideTransition
  RotationTransition

  When we work with Transition that change position of Widget in UI,
  At that time GlobalKey is very important

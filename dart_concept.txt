* Class :
  -----
  
   Abstract Class & Super :

   Interface :
      A non-abstract class must always have an implementation for its own interface.
   
      MIMP -> every class must implements its own interface


  Class vs Abstract Class vs Interface :
  -------------------
   -> Class possess only { concrete things } (not signature only) [Except - external methods]

   -> Abstract Class can possess { signatures + concrete things }

   -> Interface only possess { signatures }



  Mixins :
  -----
   -> class closest to child class is the one present on RHS

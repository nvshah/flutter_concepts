* MultiThread & Concurrency :
  -------------------

  -> Concurrency is a great technique to run some code in background
     while keeping your app running smoothly & animations smoothly

* Isolates :
  ---
  - Isolates are construct to run multiple threads of execution, concurrently
  => All dart code runs in an Isolates

  - Each isolates has a chunk of memory & single thread running an event loop

* Event Loop :
  ---
  - Lots of event happens during an app lifecycle
    Such as
    1. Tap Events
    3. IO Finishes Loading
    2. Repaint

  - For Smooth running the Flutter adds `Repaint` events in the Event loop 60 times a second (ie 1 for each frame)

  Q. When does an app becomes unresponsive ??
  -> when it missess some frames (ie `Repaint` Events) from main event loop

REMEMBER :
  -> The Any Sync funciton may block the main Event Loop from main Isolate resulting in missing frames thus
     causing non-smooth/un-responsive app
     or
     Frozen Animation

  -> because main app is booked for few frames & cannot do RePaint till that heavy task is finished


* VM Thread :
  ---
  -> Whenever we do anything async task it is done seperately on VM thread


* TIP :
  ---
  - Whenever you have some work to do, which cannot be completed between 2 frames
    then its good to offshore that work to diff thread
    ensuring main isolates produces 60 FPS for smooth user experience

* Isolate & Another Thread :
  ----
  -> In dart you can offload new work to another thread by spawning a new isolate
  -> New isolate works concurrently alongwith the main isolate

* To provide Size of a Widget in terms of percentage %
  =>
   You can use these widgets :- { MediaQuery, FractionallySizedBox, Expanded, Flexible, ... }
  -> FractionalOffset is also useful
___________


* Responsive Layout in Flutter :
  --------------
   2 ways 
   1) Mediaquery
   2) LayoutBuilder


* Mediaquery :
  -----
   - Here we manually need to store variable & write logics

   - orientations 
       - potrait or landscape

   - isMobile or Tablet
       - size.shortSide < 600 

* OrientationBuilder :
  ------
   -> Widget that can be used in place of Mediaquery

* LayoutBuilder :
  ----
   - Here under the hood its using Mediaquery (I guess)
   - It provides us with Widget So that we can use it in Widget Tree directly
   - It provide Consntraints as well

* ConstrainedBox :
  ----
   - allow to impose constraints to child widget 
     {minHeight, maxHeight, maxWidth, minWidth, etc...}

   - If you not provide any constraints then also by default Flutter inflicts the constraints to
     its child widgets
      Eg Scaffold imposes ScreenSize as a Constraints to its child

   Loose Constraints :
   ---
    -> if minWidth & minHeight is 0 then it is called as a Loose Constraints

   Unbounded Constraints :
   ---
    -> infinity kinda   // maxHeight = infinity  or maxWidth = infinity

   Column also introduce Consntraints to its children 
     \
      -> For Width - it imposes loose constraints 
         For Height - it imposes unbounded constraints

   ListView imposes 
     \
      minWidth as ScreenWidth  // only diff between ListView & Column

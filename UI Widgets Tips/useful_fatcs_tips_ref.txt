* To display SnackBar :
  -----
   -> You need messengerKey := GlobalKey<ScaffoldMessengerState>()

* To get the State of Ancestor Widget :
  ---
  (ref : https://mobikul.com/reload-restart-app-in-flutter/)
   -> context.findAncestorStateOfType<_StateType>()

* Inorder to Customise the ScrollBehavior :
  ----
   -> You can extends the MaterialScrollBehavior Class
   -> This way you can override the GlowingOverScrollIndicator decoration behavior
      by overriding the `buildOverScrollIndicator`

   -> You can override the `dragDevices` getter to indicate what devices drag is listened & supported by this
      Scrollable behavior

   ScrollNotifications :
   - Scrollable widgets informs their ancestors about scrolling-related changes.
   - These notifications can be listened bu the NotificationsListener Widget

   You can use ScrollNotifications to listen the scroll positions


* ListView & SetState :
  -----
  - Normally ListView will not scroll to first element on setState
    because
    key=null consider before & after list as same & will try to hold the scroll position

    But if you provide UniqueKey, then It may forgets the Scroll position

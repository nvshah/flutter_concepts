* LimitedBox :
  ----
   - ListView & Colum has verticaly unbounded constraints (chance to overflow err)

   - You can use LimitedBox to limit the height in such case 
   - NOTE :- LimitedBox will be in effect only when parent has Unnbounded Constraints
             otherwise
             LimitedBox will not have any effect anymore & will be kinda ignored
   
   => Thus LimitedBox doesn't have any effect if parent imposes some fixed Height to it(child)

   - You cann use LimitedBox as a child of either Column or ListView, for an Eg

* Constraints :
  ----
  => Every Widgets in flutter will impose some constraints on its child widgets
  -> Loose Constraints &
     Unbounded Constraints
     Tight Constraints (min = max)

* Scrollable Widget : (Behavior)
  ---
  -> SingleChildScrollView + Column {CustomHeader, Body}
  -> CustomScrollView + ScrollConfiguration + Custom Header {Sliver Padding, SliverToBoxAdapter, etc ...}

  -> ScrollBehavior

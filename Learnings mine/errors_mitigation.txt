JAVA 11 error (Mostly with gradle wrapper properties & plugin version conflicts)

 2 files need to take care:- 1) build.gradle  (app level)
                             2) gradle-wrapper.properties

> Android Gradle plugin requires Java 11 to run. You are currently using Java 1.8.
     You can try some of the following options:
       - changing the IDE settings.
       - changing the JAVA_HOME environment variable.
       - changing `org.gradle.java.home` in `gradle.properties`.

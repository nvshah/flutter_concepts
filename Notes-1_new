=> json & xml are 2 different most widely used for translation & manipulation of data between 2 parties

------------------

-> Mappings (aka dict in python) have each entry a particular specific type i.e -> MapEntry(k, v)

- If you perform .map() on Map<K, V> 

   - then you will get Map itself with its items being manipulated.

-----------

Expanded & Align - 

  If you want your widget not to be expanded under Expanded() widget, then you need to use Align() widget

  Align( align: Alignment.bottomCenter, child: yourWidget() )

  What above does is prevent your widget in expanded space & make it appear at bottom of the expanded space.
  So it will let it child preserve its own proportions.


---------

Placing container under list view doesn't change size of container as Listview does not imposed any constraints on its child

i.e It. Is unconstrained.

  In such case LimitedBox can give its child dimensions in unbounded environment

 
 Un bounded environments Eg -> Listview, GridView

---------

Provider

To be able to access providers accross navigations, you need to provide it before MaterialApp as followss

ProxyProvider

 -> helps to access previous provider & utilise in current one
    also we can use .custom() to provide custom provider instead of using simple Provider class

     i.e eg if you want your ProxyProvider for ChangeNotifier

            then - ProxyProvider<t1, t2>.custom(
                  builder:
                  providerBuilder:
                 )
            is the way to do so

App lifeCycle

 When we minimise and return back then it shows us the last page where we left off
 But it start checks & rendering from Root Widget

  I,e  didChangeDependencies() method will not called for last left off page
                               But this method will be called for all pages i.e for all widgets from root and it will come till where we left off


----------

 didUpdateWidget -> used when particular widget is not created entirely new
                    But some of param are modified by flutter underwood
                    So this method will called and gives us the old widget that has been changed
                    So if the widget's parameter only changes than flutter do not create new widget every time instead it uses same widget & update the properties of widget, with didUpdateWidget(), build(), calls...

----------

Stateful Widget -> widget property

  If you want to access widget.someProperty inside constructor of stateful widget state's.
  You cannot access widget. Syntax over there as widget. Is available only after build()

  Solution -> pass that property as parameter to constructor

----------

Bloc
 -> inorder to customise bloc listening/consuming use condition param of BlocBuilder()


----------

Theme
 -> If you want to cusotmise Theme for your specific page or widget then Wrap that widget under Theme widget

    and provide Theme as part of data arg

     eg Theme(
         data : Theme.of(conext).copyWith(),
         child: yourWidget(),
        )

Visibility () | Opacity() | Offstage()

To Disable the Widget You can also use :
AbsorbPointer()

* TextFieldController & TextSelection :
  ---
  2 properties are there with controller
  text & selection

  selection : TextSelection
    \
     -> It decides how many positions or characters to consider while selecting this particular character at position

  REMEMBER:-
  Because Emojis & other other requires more unicode characters to form a single visibly symbol
